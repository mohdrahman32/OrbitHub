        <h2>Moons: The Companions of Planets</h2>
        <p>Moons are natural satellites that orbit planets, playing significant roles in shaping the dynamics of their parent planets and the solar system as a whole. With diverse compositions, sizes, and features, moons offer fascinating insights into the universe.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Formation and Characteristics</h3>
        <p>Moons are formed through various processes, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Capture:</strong> A passing celestial body gets trapped by a planet's gravitational pull.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Debris from collisions forms into a satellite.</li>
            <li><strong>Co-Formation:</strong> Moons form simultaneously with their parent planets from the same disk of material.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moons vary greatly in size, from tiny asteroid-like bodies to massive ones like Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Types of Moons</h3>
        <p>Moons differ in composition and characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Terrestrial Moons:</strong> Rocky bodies, such as Earth’s Moon.</li>
            <li><strong>Icy Moons:</strong> Composed primarily of ice and rock, such as Europa and Enceladus.</li>
            <li><strong>Volcanic Moons:</strong> Some moons, like Io, exhibit active volcanism.</li>
            <li><strong>Irregular Moons:</strong> Oddly shaped and often captured objects, like Neptune’s Triton.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Role of Moons</h3>
        <p>Moons have significant effects on their parent planets:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gravitational Influence:</strong> They create tides, stabilize axial tilt, and influence planetary rotations.</li>
            <li><strong>Surface Protection:</strong> Larger moons may deflect meteor impacts from their planets.</li>
            <li><strong>Scientific Interest:</strong> Moons like Europa and Enceladus harbor subsurface oceans, raising the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Earth’s Moon</h3>
        <p>Earth’s Moon is unique in its close relationship with our planet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tides and Eclipses:</strong> It causes ocean tides and eclipses visible from Earth.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Impact:</strong> The Moon has inspired mythology, art, and scientific exploration throughout human history.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> Missions like Apollo and modern programs aim to explore the Moon's surface and resources.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Notable Moons in the Solar System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Europa (Jupiter):</strong> An icy moon with a subsurface ocean that may host life.</li>
            <li><strong>Titan (Saturn):</strong> Features rivers and lakes of liquid methane, with a thick atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Phobos and Deimos (Mars):</strong> Small, irregularly shaped moons believed to be captured asteroids.</li>
            <li><strong>Charon (Pluto):</strong> A large moon that forms a binary system with its dwarf planet.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Moons are essential in understanding planetary systems and the universe's history. Their diversity and unique features make them vital targets for scientific study, offering clues about the formation of celestial bodies and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>
