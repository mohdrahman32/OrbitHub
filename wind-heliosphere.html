            <h2>The Solar Wind and Heliosphere: The Sun's Expanding Influence</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The solar wind and the heliosphere are interconnected phenomena that define the Sun's interaction with the rest of the solar system. They play critical roles in shaping the space environment and protecting the planets from cosmic radiation.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>The Solar Wind</h3>
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>The solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles, primarily electrons and protons, released from the Sun's outer atmosphere (the corona).</p>

            <h4>Characteristics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Travels at speeds ranging from 300 to 800 km/s.</li>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Mostly hydrogen nuclei (protons), with some helium nuclei and electrons.</li>
                <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Generated by the Sun’s hot corona, where the high temperatures allow particles to escape the Sun’s gravity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Effects of the Solar Wind</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Auroras:</strong> Interaction with Earth's magnetic field creates auroras near the poles (e.g., Northern and Southern Lights).</li>
                <li><strong>Space Weather:</strong> Causes geomagnetic storms that can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communication systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF):</strong> Carries the Sun’s magnetic field throughout the solar system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Importance of Study</h4>
            <p>Understanding the solar wind helps predict space weather events and protect technological infrastructure on Earth and astronauts in space.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>The Heliosphere</h3>
            <h4>Definition</h4>
            <p>The heliosphere is a vast bubble-like region of space dominated by the solar wind and the Sun's magnetic field, extending far beyond the planets and shielding the solar system from cosmic radiation.</p>

            <h4>Structure of the Heliosphere</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heliospheric Current Sheet:</strong> A wavy surface where the Sun's magnetic field changes polarity.</li>
                <li><strong>Termination Shock:</strong> The point where the solar wind slows down as it encounters the interstellar medium.</li>
                <li><strong>Heliosheath:</strong> The outer layer of the heliosphere, where the solar wind becomes turbulent.</li>
                <li><strong>Heliopause:</strong> The boundary between the heliosphere and interstellar space, marking the edge of the Sun’s influence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Size</h4>
            <p>The heliosphere extends approximately 120–140 AU from the Sun. It is not spherical but shaped like a teardrop, with a longer tail in the direction opposite to the Sun’s motion through the galaxy.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Exploration of the Heliosphere</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voyager Missions:</strong> Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have crossed the heliopause and are providing data about the interstellar medium.</li>
                <li><strong>Parker Solar Probe:</strong> Studying the Sun’s corona and the origin of the solar wind.</li>
                <li><strong>Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP):</strong> A future mission designed to study the heliosphere’s boundary and its interaction with interstellar space.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>

            <h3>Effects of the Heliosphere</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cosmic Radiation Shield:</strong> Protects the planets and inner solar system from high-energy galactic cosmic rays.</li>
                <li><strong>Influence on Comets:</strong> Shapes the tails of comets, with the solar wind pushing dust tails away from the Sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Defining the Solar System’s Boundary:</strong> The heliosphere marks the boundary of the Sun's influence, distinguishing the solar system from interstellar space.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
