            <h1>Asteroids, Comets, and Meteoroids: Small but Mighty Solar System Bodies</h1>
            <p>Asteroids, comets, and meteoroids are small celestial objects that play vital roles in the dynamics and history of the solar system. Though often considered "minor bodies," they hold clues to the formation of planets and the solar system's evolution.</p>

            <h2>1. Asteroids</h2>
            <video src="asteroids/asteroids.mp4" autoplay loop muted class="video-small"></video>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the Sun, primarily found in the <strong>Asteroid Belt</strong> between Mars and Jupiter.</p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Range from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in diameter.</li>
                <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Made of rock, metals, and sometimes small amounts of ice.</li>
                <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Typically irregular, though some are roughly spherical.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Asteroids</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C-Type (Carbonaceous):</strong> Dark, carbon-rich, and the most common type.</li>
                <li><strong>S-Type (Silicaceous):</strong> Composed of silicate and nickel-iron, found closer to the Sun.</li>
                <li><strong>M-Type (Metallic):</strong> Rich in metals like nickel and iron, likely from fragmented cores of differentiated bodies.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr class="animated-hr">

            <h2>2. Comets</h2>
            <video src="asteroids/comets.mp4" autoplay loop muted class="video-small"></video>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>Comets are icy bodies that release gas and dust when they approach the Sun, creating a glowing <strong>coma</strong> and a characteristic <strong>tail</strong>.</p>
            <h3>Characteristics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nucleus:</strong> A solid core of ice, dust, and rock.</li>
                <li><strong>Coma:</strong> A cloud of gas and dust surrounding the nucleus.</li>
                <li><strong>Tail:</strong> A glowing stream of particles pushed by solar wind and radiation.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr class="animated-hr">

            <h2>3. Meteoroids</h2>
            <video src="asteroids/meteoroids.mp4" autoplay loop muted class="video-small"></video>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>Meteoroids are small pieces of rock or metal traveling through space, ranging from dust-sized grains to objects a few meters in size.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meteor:</strong> When a meteoroid enters Earthâ€™s atmosphere and burns up, creating a streak of light in the sky (a "shooting star").</li>
                <li><strong>Meteorite:</strong> If a meteoroid survives its journey through the atmosphere and reaches Earth's surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Fireball:</strong> A particularly bright meteor.</li>
            </ul>
