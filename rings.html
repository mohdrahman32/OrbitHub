        <h2>Rings in the Solar System: Majestic Structures of Ice and Rock</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>Rings are stunning and iconic features of some celestial bodies in our solar system. They are vast, flat structures composed of countless small particles orbiting around a planet or other objects. Most prominently, rings are associated with the giant planets, but they are also found around some smaller bodies.</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>What Are Rings?</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>Definition</h4>
        <p>Planetary rings are collections of particles ranging in size from tiny grains of dust to large chunks of ice and rock, orbiting a central body due to its gravitational influence.</p>

        <h4>Composition</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ice:</strong> Water ice is a significant component, giving rings their brightness.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocky Material:</strong> Includes dust and larger rocky debris.</li>
            <li><strong>Organic Compounds:</strong> Some rings, like Saturn's, contain complex molecules.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3>Formation of Rings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tidal Forces:</strong> Gravitational forces prevent the ring material from forming into a moon within the Roche limit, a region close to a planet where tidal forces overcome gravitational cohesion.</li>
            <li><strong>Collision Debris:</strong> Rings may form from debris resulting from collisions between moons, comets, or asteroids.</li>
            <li><strong>Captured Material:</strong> Icy or rocky material from other celestial objects can be captured into a ring system.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3>Planets with Rings</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4>1. Saturn: The King of Rings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Saturn has the most extensive and brightest ring system, visible even through small telescopes.</li>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Composed of seven main rings labeled A to G, separated by gaps like the Cassini Division.</li>
            <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Mostly water ice with some dust and rocky particles.</li>
            <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Likely formed from a shattered moon or cometary debris.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h4>2. Jupiter: Faint and Dusty Rings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Jupiter's rings are faint and primarily composed of dust.</li>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Includes a main ring, a halo ring, and two gossamer rings formed by debris from its moons.</li>
            <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Material likely comes from meteoroid impacts on its small inner moons.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h4>3. Uranus: Narrow and Dark Rings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Uranus has 13 known narrow rings, which are dark and less reflective.</li>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Includes a series of thin rings made of icy and rocky particles.</li>
            <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Likely formed from shattered moons or collisional debris.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h4>4. Neptune: Arcs and Rings</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Neptune’s ring system includes faint rings with bright clumps known as arcs.</li>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Four prominent rings with varying density and composition.</li>
            <li><strong>Origin:</strong> Possibly formed from debris created by moon collisions or gravitational interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3>Smaller Bodies with Rings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chariklo:</strong> A minor planet in the Centaur class, Chariklo has two narrow rings made of water ice and rocky material.</li>
            <li><strong>Haumea:</strong> A dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, Haumea is the first such body known to have a ring system.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
