        <h2>Dwarf Planets: Small but Significant Worlds</h2>
        <p>
            Dwarf planets are celestial bodies in the solar system that share some characteristics with planets but differ in key ways. Defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006, a dwarf planet must:
            <ul>
                <li>Orbit the Sun.</li>
                <li>Have sufficient mass for a nearly round shape.</li>
                <li>Not clear its orbital neighborhood of other debris.</li>
                <li>Not be a satellite.</li>
            </ul>
            There are five officially recognized dwarf planets in the solar system: Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Position:</strong> Located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune.</li>
                <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Found in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh and classified as a planet until 2006.</li>
                <li><strong>Surface and Composition:</strong> Composed of rock and ice, with nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide frosts covering its surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Thin and seasonal, primarily composed of nitrogen with traces of methane and carbon monoxide.</li>
                <li><strong>Moons:</strong> Pluto has five known moons, with Charon being the largest. Charon is so large relative to Pluto that they form a binary system.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploration:</strong> NASA’s <i>New Horizons</i> mission provided detailed images and data in 2015, revealing mountains, plains, and possible subsurface oceans.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Position:</strong> Found in the scattered disk, a region farther out than the Kuiper Belt.</li>
                <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Discovered in 2005 by a team led by Michael E. Brown, it prompted the reclassification of Pluto.</li>
                <li><strong>Surface and Composition:</strong> Highly reflective, likely covered with a thin layer of methane ice.</li>
                <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Has a temporary atmosphere when closest to the Sun, created by sublimating methane.</li>
                <li><strong>Moon:</strong> Has one known moon, Dysnomia, which helps scientists estimate Eris’s mass.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Eris is slightly smaller in diameter than Pluto but more massive, making it a key factor in redefining planetary criteria.</li>

                <li><strong>Position:</strong> Located in the Kuiper Belt.</li>
                <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Discovered in 2004 by teams in the U.S. and Spain.</li>
                <li><strong>Unique Shape:</strong> Haumea is elongated due to its rapid rotation, completing one spin every four hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Surface and Composition:</strong> Composed mostly of rock and a thin icy crust, with water ice contributing to its high reflectivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Moons:</strong> Haumea has two moons, Hi’iaka and Namaka, named after Hawaiian deities.</li>
                <li><strong>Rings:</strong> It is the only dwarf planet known to have a ring system.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Significance:</strong> Named after the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth.</li>

                <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Discovered in 2005 by the same team that found Eris.</li>
                <li><strong>Surface and Composition:</strong> Covered in methane, ethane, and nitrogen ice, giving it a reddish hue.</li>
                <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Evidence suggests it may have a transient atmosphere when closest to the Sun.</li>
                <li><strong>Moon:</strong> Has one known moon, MK 2, discovered in 2016.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> Its high reflectivity and unique composition make it an intriguing object for study.</li>

                <li><strong>Surface and Composition:</strong> A mix of rock and ice, with evidence of water-ice beneath its surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Unique Features:</strong> Contains bright spots, such as those in the Occator Crater, believed to be deposits of salt or ice.</li>
                <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Thin and transient, possibly due to water vapor outgassing.</li>
