        <h2>The Sun: The Heart of Our Solar System</h2>
        <p>The Sun is a massive celestial body at the center of our solar system. It provides the energy necessary for life on Earth and influences many natural phenomena. Here is an overview of the Sun's significance and characteristics:</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Composition and Structure</h3>
        <p>The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (around 24%), with traces of heavier elements. It has a layered structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Core:</strong> The innermost part where nuclear fusion occurs, producing immense energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Radiative Zone:</strong> Surrounding the core, this region transfers energy outward through radiation.</li>
            <li><strong>Convective Zone:</strong> The outer layer of the Sun’s interior, where energy moves via convection currents.</li>
            <li><strong>Photosphere:</strong> The visible surface of the Sun, emitting the light we see.</li>
            <li><strong>Chromosphere and Corona:</strong> The outer atmospheric layers, visible during solar eclipses, emit ultraviolet and X-ray radiation.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Source of Energy</h3>
        <p>The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium in its core. This process releases enormous amounts of energy as light and heat, which sustain life on Earth.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Role in the Solar System</h3>
        <p>The Sun's gravitational pull keeps planets, asteroids, and comets in orbit. It also regulates the climate and weather on Earth by providing consistent energy.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Importance for Life on Earth</h3>
        <p>Sunlight is vital for photosynthesis, the process plants use to produce food, forming the basis of most ecosystems. Additionally, the Sun drives the water cycle and influences weather patterns, making it essential for Earth's habitability.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Phenomena Associated with the Sun</h3>
        <p>The Sun exhibits dynamic phenomena, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Solar Flares:</strong> Sudden bursts of energy that can affect satellite communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Sunspots:</strong> Cooler, darker areas on the Sun's surface linked to magnetic activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Auroras:</strong> Natural light displays caused by solar particles interacting with Earth’s magnetic field.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The Sun is much more than a star; it is the life-giving center of our solar system. Understanding its structure, energy, and influence highlights its vital role in supporting life and shaping the universe around us.</p>
